# Contributing to Student Insights

As a first step, please take a little time to become familiar with the project at a high level by reviewing our [README.md](README.md) file and exploring around this repository.  To talk with other people about way to help, the best first step is to come drop into [chat](https://cfb-public.slack.com/messages/somerville-schools/), or connect with [Alex](https://twitter.com/alexsoble) or [Kevin](https://twitter.com/krob) on Twitter. 

If you're **an educator** and want to try this out or have ideas about how to improve the product, we'd love to hear from you.  If you're **an experienced developer or designer**, there's some work we could use help with and you dive right into it.  We'll work with you to make sure your work can ship and will immediately help out principals and teachers.

When talking about or suggesting product and design improvemnts, it's helpful to frame these in a few different steps:
  1. Identify what problem we're trying to help the user with and why it matters.
  2. What design or UX improvements can help the user with that problem? What are the tradeoffs in the solution?
  3. How can we execute on sequencing the work or building it in code?
