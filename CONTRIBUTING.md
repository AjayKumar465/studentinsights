# Contributing to Student Insights

This project is in active development.  Currently, we consider the code base an alpha product. We are still working out bugs and building out new features.  We'd love your help and encourage participation, collaboration and contribution to this project.  Here's how: 

## First, take a look around

As a first step, please take a little time to become familiar with the project at a high level by reviewing our [README.md](README.md) file and exploring around this repository.  To talk with other people about way to help, the best first step is to come drop into [chat](https://cfb-public.slack.com/messages/somerville-schools/), or connect with [Alex](https://twitter.com/alexsoble) or [Kevin](https://twitter.com/krob) on Twitter. 

If you're **an educator** and want to try this out or have ideas about how to improve the product, we'd love to hear from you.  If you're **an experienced developer or designer**, there's some work we could use help with and you dive right into it.  We'll work with you to make sure your work can ship and will immediately help out principals and teachers.

## Get clear on the basic problem or issue you want to work on

When talking about or suggesting product and design improvemnts, it's helpful to frame these in a few different steps:
  1. Identify what problem we're trying to help the user with and why it matters.
  2. What design or UX improvements can help the user with that problem? What are the tradeoffs in the solution?
  3. How can we execute on sequencing the work or building it in code?

## Have an Issue With Us?  Good! 

One of the most valuable ways anybody can contribute to this project is by identifying bugs and other issues to look at.  It is easy to create an issue ticket on GitHub with the [click of a button](https://github.com/studentinsights/studentinsights/issues/new). Before you submit a new issue, please take a look at the other issues (both [open](https://github.com/studentinsights/studentinsights/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue) and [closed](https://github.com/studentinsights/studentinsights/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) and the [README](README.md) file to check if it is already be addressed.  

## If It's Tuesday, It Must Be Hack Night! 

Join us pretty much every Tuesday night to hack together on this project.  A group of us gathers in person as part of [Code for Boston](http://www.codeforboston.org).  Pizza, beverages, learn new things, meet new people and squash new bugs!
